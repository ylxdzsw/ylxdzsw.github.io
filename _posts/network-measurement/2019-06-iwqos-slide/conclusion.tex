        \item Though IEEE 802.11ac equipment has become the mainstream in the market, only a small portion (6\%) of Wifi connections exceed PHY rates of 300Mbps.
        \item More than one third of ISPs we observed do not deploy 4G networks.
        \item Many users use external DNS resolvers. IP Anycast may improve the mobile app performance in this case.
        \item XMPP traffic experiences longer RTT than HTTPS, which suggests that IM and VoIP services still have room for improvement.
        \item Advertisements servers often have longer latency than application servers.

        \item 5G deployment and performance
        \item Actively measure the server when unexpected high RTTs are observed.
        % \item Site studies to find the reason for WiFi not always working at their highest speed
