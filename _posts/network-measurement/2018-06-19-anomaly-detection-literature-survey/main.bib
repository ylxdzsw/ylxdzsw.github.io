	abstract = {Mobile networks are under more pressure than ever before because of the increasing number of smartphone users and the number of people relying on mobile data networks. With larger numbers of users, the issue of service quality has become more important for network operators. Identifying faults in mobile networks that reduce the quality of service must be found within minutes so that problems can be addressed and networks returned to optimised performance. In this paper, a method of automated fault diagnosis is presented using decision trees, rules and Bayesian classifiers for visualization of network faults. Using data mining techniques the model classifies optimisation criteria based on the key performance indicators metrics to identify network faults supporting the most efficient optimisation decisions. The goal is to help wireless providers to localize the key performance indicator alarms and determine which Quality of Service factors should be addressed first and at which locations.},

	abstract = {Providing high end-to-end (E2E) performance is critical for cellular service providers to best serve their customers. Detecting and localizing E2E performance degradation is crucial for cellular service providers, content providers, device manufactures, and application developers to jointly troubleshoot root causes. To the best of our knowledge, detection and localization of E2E performance degradation at cellular service providers has not been previously studied. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach to detecting and localizing E2E performance degradation at cellular service providers across the four dimensions of user locations, content providers, device types, and application types. First, we use training data to build models that can capture the normal performance of every E2E-instance, which means ﬂows corresponding to a speciﬁc location, content provider, device type, and application type. Second, we use our models to detect performance degradation for each E2E-instance on an hourly basis. Third, after each E2E-instance has been labeled as non-degrading or degrading, we use association rule mining techniques to localize the source of performance degradation. Our system detected performance degradation instances over a period of one week. In 80\% of the detected degraded instances, content providers, device types, and application types were the only factors of performance degradation.},

	abstract = {This research work deals with efficient data mining procedure for predicting the diabetes from medical records of patients. Diabetes is a very common disease these days in all populations and in all age groups. Diabetes contributes to heart disease, increases the risks of developing kidney disease, nerve damage, blood vessel damage and blindness. So mining the diabetes data in efficient manner is a critical issue. The Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set is used in this paper; which collects the information of patients with and without having diabetes. The modified J48 classifier is used to increase the accuracy rate of the data mining procedure. The data mining tool {WEKA} has been used as an {API} of {MATLAB} for generating the J-48 classifiers. Experimental results showed a significant improvement over the existing J-48 algorithm.},

	abstract = {The alternating decision tree ({ADTree}) is a successful classification technique that combines decision trees with the predictive accuracy of boosting into a set of interpretable classification rules. The original formulation of the tree induction algorithm restricted attention to binary classification problems. This paper empirically evaluates several wrapper methods for extending the algorithm to the multiclass case by splitting the problem into several two-class problems. Seeking a more natural solution we then adapt the multiclass {LogitBoost} and {AdaBoost}.{MH} procedures to induce alternating decision trees directly. Experimental results confirm that these procedures are comparable with wrapper methods that are based on the original {ADTree} formulation in accuracy, while inducing much smaller trees.},

	abstract = {When modeling a probability distribution with a Bayesian network, we are faced with the problem of how to handle continuous variables. Most previous work has either solved the problem by discretizing, or assumed that the data are generated by a single Gaussian. In this paper we abandon the normality assumption and instead use statistical methods for nonparametric density estimation. For a naive Bayesian classifier, we present experimental results on a variety of natural and artificial domains, comparing two methods of density estimation: assuming normality and modeling each conditional distribution with a single Gaussian; and using nonparametric kernel density estimation. We observe large reductions in error on several natural and artificial data sets, which suggests that kernel estimation is a useful tool for learning Bayesian models.},

	abstract = {In the forthcoming years, different radio access technologies ({GSM}, {GPRS}, {UMTS}, etc.) will have to coexist within the same cellular network. In this scenario of increasingly complex networks, automated management is becoming a crucial issue to provide high-quality services. In this paper, a system for automatic fault diagnosis of the radio access part of a mobile communication system is presented. For this purpose, a probabilistic diagnosis model based on discrete Bayesian networks ({BNs}) is proposed. There is always a trade-off between accuracy and complexity of the model. Hence, two alternative structures to code the dependencies among elements in the model are compared with regard to their simplicity and performance. Empirical results are examined, based on data from a live {GSM}/{GPRS} network. Taking into account the experiments, a {BN} structure is selected for diagnosis in cellular networks},
