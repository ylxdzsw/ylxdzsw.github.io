    \begin{itemize}
        \item Though IEEE 802.11ac equipments has become the mainstream in the market, only a small portion (6\%) of Wifi exceed PHY rates of 300Mbps.
        \item Still more than one third of the ISPs do not deploy 4G networks.
        \item There are many users use external DNS resolvers. IP Anycast may improve the mobile app performance in this case.
        \item Traffics using XMPP protocols experience longer RTT than HTTPS, which suggests that IM and VoIP services can be further improved.
        \item Advertisements servers often have longer latency than application servers.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 5G deployment and performance
        \item Actively measure the server when unexpected high RTTs are observed.
        % \item Site studies to find the reason for WiFi not always working at their highest speed
    \end{itemize}
